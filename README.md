# REFINER: Reasoning Feedback on Intermediate Representations :rocket:
Official implementation of [REFINER: Reasoning Feedback on Intermediate Representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.01904.pdf)


This repo proposes REFINER, an interaction-based framework for natural language reasoning tasks ðŸ”¥. REFINER is a framework that refines LMs reasoning capabilities through feedback. Our work is the first to investigate how interacting with fine-grained reasoning feedback on intermediate reasoning steps impacts the performance of LMs on reasoning tasks.
